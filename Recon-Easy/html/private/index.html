        <h2>North Torbia's Backstory</h2>
        <p>
            North Torbia, a jewel of the global landscape largely unknown and certainly unvisited by anyone with a decent Wi-Fi connection, harbored ambitions far exceeding its technological capabilities. While the rest of the world marveled at gigabit speeds, North Torbia‚Äôs national internet infrastructure hummed along at the pace of a tired snail, powered by a complex network of repurposed agricultural equipment.<br><br>
            The national mainframe, affectionately known as "The Iron Potato," was a relic from a bygone era. Yet, within this technologically challenged nation, a bold vision began to take root: global IT dominance. This audacious plan can be traced back to a momentous occasion when the Supreme Leader, while attempting to access a weather forecast on a dial-up connection that sounded suspiciously like a distressed badger, discovered the world of cyber warfare...
